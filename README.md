# UCI-World-Channel-Data-Report
Analyzing the World Channel subset of the online news popularity data provided by the University of
California, Irvine. This dataset contains 39,644 observations, each being an article from
Mashable, an international media platform. There were 61 attributes, 2 non-predictive which we
used to divide the data into relevant subsets, and there are 58 predictor variables used to
determine the popularity or number of clicks, each article received. Our target variable was
“shares”, which described the number of shares an article received.

The task is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the data to determine which variables 
are most “relevant” when it comes to determining an article's popularity. Some of the specific
variables he was interested in were sentiment, LDA, media, and days of the week. Off the bat,
we did find those variables to be important, but we will get into that further in the next section of
our report. Additionally, after looking at the variables, we found that many variables relate to the
same characteristic. We found that most of the variables described the rate and number of text,
unique words, and keywords, as well as described the number of references, media, and word
length used in the article. We also saw that variables described when the article was posted, their
closeness to specified topics, as well as information regarding the sentiment and polarity of the
article.
